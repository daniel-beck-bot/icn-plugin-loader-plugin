  This the location of the jar file on the server,
  for instance /opt/IBM/ECMClient/plugins/myplugin.jar, can be a variable.
  The file needs to be copied first via another build task, this plug-in
  does not copy the file for you. You can use an SSH copy, FTP, NFS share, ...
  If ICN is deployed on a cluster, you have to replace the jar on all instances,
  except if you already have the plug-in in a shared location.
