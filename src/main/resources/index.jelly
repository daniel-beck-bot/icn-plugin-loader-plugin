<div>
  This plug-in reloads automatically and remotely a plug-in on an IBM Content Navigator server. The plug-in
  jar file needs to be already on the server but it will reload it without stopping the application.
  This is suitable for development platform, as well as for production platform where you don't
  want any interruption of service. Although the plug-in's services will be using the new version as
  soon as you run the task, user will have to reload/refresh their cache to use the last
  version of all JavaScript files, (or wait 24h hours, default Cache-Control time for ICN).
  This works for an application managed authentication so far, not if you're using an other
  mechanism (basic, form based, ...)
